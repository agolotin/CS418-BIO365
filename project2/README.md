#Project 2 DeBrujin Graph Assembler
The working version resides in graph_assembler.py. All of the test files are in datasets/ directory. 
Tests/ directory contains all of the outputs from running the datasets. It also contains the script for running all of 
the datasets one after another.
graph_assembler.py and assembler.py differ only in the error checking methods. However, assembler.py error checking is extremely 
weak copared to graph_assembler.py
